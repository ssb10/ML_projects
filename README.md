# ML_projects
Projects completed as a part of Machine Learning Certification

These projects are using various machine learning techniques like linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, Support Vector Machine to mention a few.

I have completed them as a part of Machine Learning Certification by Standford University on Coursera. The code is written for Octave. It can be run on Matlab as well.
