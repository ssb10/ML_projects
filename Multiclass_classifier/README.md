The aim is to recognize handwriiten digits. There are two approaches used here - 
1) Regularized logistic regression
2) Neural Networks

dataset of 5000 handwritten digits is used to perform multi-class classification to detect numbers zero to nine.
Implemented multiple regularized logistic regression classifiers to predict probability of each class.
Implemented feed forward Neural Networks and back propagation to recognize handwritten digits.
